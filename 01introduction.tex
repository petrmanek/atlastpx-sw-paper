\section{\label{sec:introduction}Introduction}
The ATLAS-MPX Network has been installed in the ATLAS cavern at the LHC at CERN~\cite{CampbellATLAS}. During the 2013-2014 shut-down period this network was upgraded to a two-layer Timepix design (ATLAS-TPX) with a faster readout system and improved capabilities to discriminate charged particles and gamma rays against neutrons~\cite{Proposal_Claude,Bergmann_ATLASTPX_2016}.

Operation of the network is managed by a distributed software system comprised of several independent components:
~
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Acquisition and Control Subsystem handles communication with detectors through the readout interface.
  \item The Data Analysis Subsystem automatically verifies and processes frames taken by detectors.
  \item The Data Visualization Application displays processed data in the form of pixel matrices and trace flux charts.
\end{itemize}
