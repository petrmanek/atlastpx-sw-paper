  abstract={A two-layer pixel detector setup (ATLAS-TPX), designed for thermal and fast neutron detection and radiation field characterization is presented. It consists of two segmented silicon detectors (256 × 256 pixels, pixel pitch 55 μm, thicknesses 300 μm and 500 μm) facing each other. To enhance the neutron detection efficiency a set of converter layers is inserted in between these detectors. The pixelation and the two-layer design allow a discrimination of neutrons against γs by pattern recognition and against charged particles by using the coincidence and anticoincidence information. The neutron conversion and detection efficiencies are measured in a thermal neutron field and fast neutron fields with energies up to 600 MeV. A Geant4 simulation model is presented, which is validated against the measured detector responses. The reliability of the coincidence and anticoincidence technique is demonstrated and possible applications of the detector setup are briefly outlined.}

Overall dimensions are basically limited only by the dimensions of the Si wafer and the packing used. Aluminium and polyethylene were utilised as the main construction materials. Responses to different kinds of radiations were measured. Efficiency of the detector for thermal neutrons is selectable approximately in the range between 5 x 10-4 and 3 x 10-2 pulses per neutron.cm-2. Efficiency of the detector for fast neutrons (e.g. from the 241Am-Be source) was determined to be approximately 10-2 times lower.},

  abstract={The future of data management for LHC at CERN brings new requirements for scalability and a change of scheduling and data handling compared to the HSM mass storage system in use today. A forecast for disk based storage volume at CERN in 2015 is on the Exabyte scale with hundreds of millions of files. A new CERN storage architecture is represented as a storage cluster with an analysis, archive and tape pool with container based data movements and decoupled namespaces. Main assets of a new system is high-availability and life cycle management for large storage installations. Today this is one of the major issues at the CERN computer centre with more than 1,000 disk servers and continuous hardware replacement. Another key point is distributed meta data handling with in-memory caching and persistent key-value stores to reduce latencies and operational complexity. Focus of this paper will be on the analysis pool implementation providing low-latency, nonsequential file access and a hierarchical namespace. A summary of performance indicators and first operational experiences will be reported.}

The detector will respond differently for different types of radiation. If the acquisition time is short enough with respect to radiation intensity, one can see characteristic tracks of individual quanta in an image taken (e.g., curved lines for electrons, round shaped clusters for alpha particles, heavy ions and slow neutrons, cone shapes for fast neutrons, simple dots for low energy X-rays, etc.). For effective visualization of neutrons, the device has to be equipped by corresponding neutron converter, which converts neutrons to heavy charged particles. By analyzing these patterns, in this so-called “tracking mode” of operation, it is possible to distinguish individual tracks and classify them into predefined categories. For each “cluster” detected, the features (such as parameters describing the shape and energy deposition estimation) can be extracted and used to distinguish radiation type. The energy deposited can be estimated by using calibration measurements with different types of radiation and variation of the discrimination threshold. "

abstract={A network of 16 Medipix-2 (MPX) silicon pixel devices was installed in the ATLAS detector cavern at CERN. It was designed to measure the composition and spectral characteristics of the radiation field in the ATLAS experiment and its surroundings. This study demonstrates that the MPX network can also be used as a self-sufficient luminosity monitoring system. The MPX detectors collect data independently of the ATLAS data-recording chain, and thus they provide independent measurements of the bunch-integrated ATLAS/LHC luminosity. In particular, the MPX detectors located close enough to the primary interaction point are used to perform van der Meer calibration scans with high precision. Results from the luminosity monitoring are presented for 2012 data taken at $sqrt s = 8$ TeV proton-proton collisions. The characteristics of the LHC luminosity reduction rate are studied and the effects of beam-beam (burn-off) and beam-gas (single bunch) interactions are evaluated. The systematic variations observed in the MPX luminosity measurements are below 0.3% for one minute intervals.},

A first test using the photon counting chip Medipix2 with \{GEM\} or Micromegas demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach. Although this experiment demonstrated that single primary electrons could be detected the chip did not provide information on the arrival time of the electron in the sensitive gas volume nor did it give any indication of the quantity of charge detected. The Timepix chip uses an external clock with a frequency of up to 100 \{MHz\} as a time reference. Each pixel contains a preamplifier, a discriminator with hysteresis and 4-bit \{DAC\} for threshold adjustment, synchronization logic and a 14-bit counter with overflow control. Moreover, each pixel can be independently configured in one of four different modes: masked mode: pixel is off, counting mode: 1-count for each signal over threshold, \{TOT\} mode: the counter is incremented continuously as long as the signal is above threshold, and arrival time mode: the counter is incremented continuously from the time the first hit arrives until the end of the shutter. The chip resembles very much the Medipix2 chip physically and can be readout using slightly modified versions of the various existing systems. This paper presents the main features of the new design, electrical measurements and some first images. "

Each Timepix pixel can be independently operated in one of three possible modes: (1) counting of the detected particles; (2) measurement of the particle energy; and (3) measurement of the time of interaction. The energy measurement in the second mode is performed via the determination of the “time-over-threshold” (TOT). The energy measurement with the Timepix detector in \{TOT\} mode requires knowledge of the energy calibration of each pixel of the matrix. Such calibration is very nonlinear in the low energy range and can be described by a surrogate function depending on four parameters. The determination of all these parameters can be performed by measurement and evaluation of the response of each pixel in at least four calibration points. The procedure is extremely demanding: it requires the analysis of at least 250 thousand spectra and the performance of 330 thousand least-squares fits. In this article, it is demonstrated that even better result can be achieved with only two or three calibration points halving the number of least-squares fits needed. The method is based on precise analysis of the shape of spectral peaks. The article also discusses the performance of energy calibrated device for spectrometry of heavy charged particles. "

Neutrons with kinetic energies up to 600 MeV were available. In order to enhance the conversion of neutrons to energetic charged particles, several converter foils and filters were attached to the 300 μm thick silicon sensor, i.e. polyethylene, polyethylene with aluminum, 6 LiF, 6 LiF with aluminum, aluminum. The Time-of-Arrival mode of the Timepix detectors has permitted the application of the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique for the assignment of the detected interactions in the form of clusters (groups of adjacent pixels) in the pixel matrix, to the kinetic energies of the incident neutrons. It was found that, for lower neutron energies ( ~ MeV range) the cluster rates below the polyethylene and the polyethylene and aluminum region, produced by recoil protons, are a good measure for the mean kinetic energies of neutrons. For energies above 50 MeV nuclear reactions in the silicon dominate the detector response. In this energy range the shape of the clusters indicates the neutron kinetic energy.}

  abstract={The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix contains an array of 256 × 256 square pixels with pitch 55 μm. In addition to high spatial granularity the single quantum counting detector Timepix can provide also energy or time information in each pixel. This device is a powerful tool for radiation and particle detection, imaging and tracking. A new readout interface for silicon pixel detectors of the Medipix family has been developed in our group in order to provide a higher frame rate and enhanced flexibility of operation. The interface consists of a field programmable gate array, a USB 2.0 interface chip, DAC, ADC and a circuit which generates bias voltage for the sensor. The main control system is placed in the FPGA circuit which fully controls the Timepix device. This approach offers an easy way how to include new functionality and extended operation. The interface for Timepix supports all operation modes of the detector (counting, TOT, timing). The FITPix is a successor of the USB 1.22 Interface and the electronic readout is built with the latest available components, which allows achieving up to 90 frames per second with a single detector. The frame rate is about 20 times faster compared to the previous system while it maintains all same capabilities supported. In addition FITPix newly enables an adjustable clock frequency and hardware triggering which is a useful tool when there is the need for synchronized operation of multiple devices. Three modes of hardware trigger have been implemented: hardware trigger which starts the measurement, hardware trigger which terminates the measurement and hardware trigger which controls measurement fully. The entire system is fully powered through the USB bus. FITPix supports also readout from several detectors in chain in which case just an external power source is required. FITPix is a fully flexible device and the user needs no other equipment. FITPix combines high performance and mobility and it opens new fields of applications. The current version of the FITPix interface has dimension 45 mm × 60 mm.}

This allows us to control, e.g. data acquisition, position and rotation of the sample (stepper motors), source parameters, temperature, etc. in a synchronized way.
