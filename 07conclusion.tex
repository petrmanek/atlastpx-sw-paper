\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusion}
A software solution was presented to control acquisition and retrieve, analyze and display frames from the ATLAS-TPX Network. All components of the system are fully operational.

In addition, the presented application has been successfully integrated with TPX detector networks in other CERN experiments such as MoEDAL or ATLAS-GPX. The Data Visualization Application is available to the scientific community upon request.
